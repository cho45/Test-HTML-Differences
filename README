DESCRIPTION
    Test::HTML::Differences is test utility that compares two strings as
    HTML and show differences with Test::Differences.

    Supplied HTML strings are normalized and show pretty formatted as it is
    shown.

    This module does not test all HTML node strictly, leading/trailing
    white-space characters that are removed by the normalize function, but
    do test whole structures of the HTML.

    For example:

      <span> foo</span>

    is called equal to following:

      <span>foo</span>

    You must test these case by other methods, for example, old-school like
    or is function as you want to test it.
